# Abstract #
On (anti)-de Sitter background, the *Heisenberg uncertainty
principle(HUP)* should be modified by the introduction of a term
proportional to the *cosmological constant* . So, in this paper I
showed the derivation of HUP from the geometry of *(anti)-de
Sitter spacetime(ADSST)*. We extend our discussion to find the
connection between the extended *generalized uncertainty
principle(EGUP)* and *triply special relativity(TSR)*.
