# Extended-Heisenberg-Uncertainty-Principle-and-Geometry-of-Anti-de-Sitter-Space #

This paper was written and completed by Riddhiman Bhattacharya on 2019 July under the mentorship of Mr. T.P Roy sir. Back at that time, they had no knowledge of using LATEX for documentation. And so they used MS WORD for typing the paper. So, in this repository I'm adding that paper and trying to do some discussions of it.

## Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) ##

The **Heisenberg uncertainty principle** is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that states that the *more precisely we know the position of a particle, the less precisely we can know its momentum, and vice versa*. This principle arises from the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics, which tells us that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle can be stated mathematically as follows:
### ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2
where Δx is the uncertainty in the position of the particle, Δp is the uncertainty in its momentum, and ℏ is the reduced Planck constant.

The famous **double slit experiment** is the experimental verification of HUP in which electrons are fired at a screen with two narrow slits, shows that the position and momentum of an electron cannot both be precisely determined at the same time. The interference pattern that emerges on the screen can only be explained by the wave-like behavior of the electrons.

The uncertainty principle has led to the development of many important technologies, such as the scanning tunneling microscope, which allows us to visualize the surfaces of materials at the atomic level.

Furthermore, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is not limited to position and momentum. It applies to any pair of observables that do not commute, such as energy and time. This has led to the development of the concept of virtual particles https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/ , which can exist for a very short amount of time, violating the conservation of energy, as allowed by the uncertainty principle.

Now let's talk about 

## Sitter Spaces ##

**De Sitter space** and **Anti-de Sitter space** are two types of curved spacetimes that arise in *Einstein's theory of general relativity*. They are named after **Willem de Sitter** and Einstein's collaborator, *Adriaan van Maanen*, respectively.

## De- Sitter Space ##

De Sitter space is a maximally symmetric spacetime with positive cosmological constant, which describes a universe that is expanding at an accelerated rate. The geometry of De Sitter space is similar to that of a sphere, but with one extra dimension. In fact, De Sitter space is often represented as a hyperbolic space with one more dimension than our physical space, so it is called a hyperbolic space of constant curvature. **The curvature of De Sitter space is positive**, meaning that it is a closed universe, which means that light rays eventually converge and the universe has a finite size.
The study of De Sitter space is important in cosmology, particularly in the study of the early universe and the inflationary period. Inflation is a theoretical process that occurred in the early universe, during which the universe expanded exponentially for a brief period of time, smoothing out any irregularities and providing an explanation for the uniformity of the cosmic microwave background radiation. De Sitter space provides a mathematical description of this period of exponential expansion and a framework for understanding the early universe and the inflationary period.

## Anti De- Sitter Space ##

**Anti-de Sitter space8* is a maximally symmetric spacetime with *negative cosmological constant*, which describes a universe that is contracting at an accelerated rate. The geometry of Anti-de Sitter space is similar to that of a saddle, with a negative curvature. Anti-de Sitter space is often represented as a hyperbolic space, but with one fewer dimension than De Sitter space. The curvature of Anti-de Sitter space is negative, meaning that it is an open universe, which means that light rays diverge and the universe has infinite size.
The study of Anti-de Sitter space is important in theoretical physics, particularly in the study of string theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00007 . In string theory, Anti-de Sitter space is used to describe the interior of black holes, which are objects predicted by general relativity that result from the collapse of massive stars. Anti-de Sitter space provides a mathematical description of the spacetime inside a black hole.

The *AdS/CFT correspondence* is a conjectured relationship between a theory of gravity in Anti-de Sitter space and a conformal field theory on its boundary. This correspondence has important implications for understanding the nature of quantum gravity and the holographic principle, which suggests that the information contained in a three-dimensional volume can be fully described by a two-dimensional surface.
Anti-de Sitter space is also important in the study of high energy physics, particularly in the study of particle physics and the behavior of quarks and gluons in a strongly coupled system. The AdS/CFT correspondence provides a framework for studying these phenomena in a mathematically tractable way.
