# Extended-Heisenberg-Uncertainty-Principle-and-Geometry-of-Anti-de-Sitter-Space
In this paper, I showed the derivation of HUP from the geometry of (anti)-de Sitter spacetime(ADSST). We extend our discussion to find the connection between the extended generalized uncertainty principle(EGUP) and triply special relativity(TSR).
