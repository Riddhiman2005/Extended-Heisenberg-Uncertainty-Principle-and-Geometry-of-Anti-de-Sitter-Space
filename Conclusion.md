# CONCLUSIONS #



I tried to find the **EUP (Extended Uncertainty Principle)** from geometric considerations on **ADSST (Anti -de Sitter Spacetime)** . We extended our process of the EGUP by **Triply special
relativity(TSR)**. Finally, we made little corrections in the temperature of Black Holes in (anti)-de Sitter background.
